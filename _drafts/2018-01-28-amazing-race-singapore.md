For the Expedition Challenge badge, the scouts in Singapore took part in an "Amazing Race" that we organised. This is of course not an officially sanctioned spin-off from the TV series, nor is there a single video camera to be seen. Leaders planned and organised the challenges at the different locations, and the role of the scouts was to first work out the different locations during their regular evening meetings, and plan their route between objectives.

Not all scouts were able to take part in the activity, so this post attempts to provide instructions so that those scouts that missed the event can still complete it and in doing so earn their badge.

{:.notice}
This post includes descriptions of the challenges and an explanation of how they should be completed. To avoid ruining the race for scouts taking part, **they should not read this blog post**, but should only be given the relevant pages from the "Challenge Pack" that can be downloaded at the end of this blog post.
