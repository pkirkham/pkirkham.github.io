There are many opinions as to what drives the oil price, and whenever there are extreme movements in the price the pundits have a field day. Some of these appear politically agreeable on the surface, such as the backlash against traders during the market peak in [2008] where speculation was blamed for driving up prices (and thus by implication the financial industry is to blame for high petrol prices). Boo! However even a cursory analysis of the data quickly reveals that there is no correlation between the net positions of traders and oil price movements, but debunking that myth almost certainly will gain close to zero attention. Call me old-fashioned, but I've always stuck by the view that oil price is controlled by the fundamentals of supply and demand. What's more it's quite easy to do using publicly available information.
