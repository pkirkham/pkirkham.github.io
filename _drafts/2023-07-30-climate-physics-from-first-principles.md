It was when I attended preparatory school in the 1980s that I was first introduced to the concept of global warming. I believe it was in 1985, in a geography lesson, that our teacher explained that there was a new subject he had to teach us that had just been introduced to the curriculum. He proceeded to apologise that he wasn't completely familiar with it because for the past several decades he had been teaching about global cooling. Apparently a new point of view had emerged and there was now a new worry about the planet getting warmer, not cooler. His main point was to keep an open mind and that either, neither or perhaps even both theories might be correct. It is a lesson that has stuck with me ever since.

In the decades since then, the world has seen the rhetoric around global warming morph into "climate change" before becoming a "climate emergency". Along the way, the narrative has moved towards one where it is imperative that we adjust our use of energy sources so as to achieve a "net zero" emission of carbon dioxide. In the context of the energy trilemma - sustainability, affordability and security (pick two) - the push is towards sustainability and security, with affordability sacrificed in pursuit of this goal.

Is the choice of sustainability and security the correct choice? Are there other options? What are the consequences of choosing an alternative path?

These are just some of the many questions that any sane rational person might have when contemplating the energy trilemma.

I was once asked at a party, by a very educated and intelligent chap, whether I agreed that the climate emergency was the most important challenge mankind faced and that we had to do something about it. I respectfully disagreed, which was at first somewhat affronting to my questioner, but thankfully he wasn't a blind zealot, and what followed was a frank and considered debate. Instead of telling me I was wrong and that I didn't know what I was talking about (sadly a common reproach I have become accustomed to) he simply asked what I did consider as more important.

This put me on the spot as I'd not formally considered it before; it was simply obvious that climate change could't possibly be at the top of the list. Thinking aloud, it wasn't long before I was spewing forth a long list of candidates: that the world's population was on average not as well off as those in the western world, with access to clean water, hunger, crime, healthcare, real pollution (as in toxic, not harmless like carbon dioxide), education, and so on, being areas where more meaningful immediate impact to the overall welfare of humanity might be more readily achieved. I went on to point out that the cost associated with addressing many of these other issues would be far less than the cost associated with reaching net zero, and that the consequences of pursuing net zero goals would likely have an unintended consequence of making life worse for much of the world's population as a result of increased energy prices and their knock-on effects. When you look at the history of the western world, we live in societies that have benefited from the industrial revolution, originally fuelled by coal. Who are we to tell others that we've changed our minds? Whilst institutions such as the International Monetary Fund have a mandate to help countries build and develop strong economies, surely it is hypocritical for them to refuse to fund power generation projects if they are based on fossil fuels?

My answer spurred an long and welcome debate into these issues. Whilst we didn't solve the all the world's problems, we did manage to find a common ground. That there are many issues that face the many societies in the world, and addressing them should take into consideration many different and conflicting consequences.

Today's debate concerning energy, society and the environment has devolved into a battle between two opposing viewpoints. On one side are those that are convinced there is no other option but to change society, and that the urgency of this necessitates extreme action. There can be no doubt because we are told "the science is settled", and anyone that dares to hold any other view is labelled a "climate denier". Sadly this attitude flys in the face of the scientific method, where hypotheses are proposed and tested until they are falsified. The crucible of science allows theories and knowledge to continue to evolve and reveal new understanding over time. In contrast, the blind acceptance of stated "facts" is not science. That approach requires faith and is more akin to religion.

This state of affairs has led me to write this blog post. To help explain to my own children the scientific principles that underpin planetary climatology, and in doing so help to better equip them to make their own decisions and choices. There is little about "climate science" that cannot be understood by most educated school children. It is sometimes claimed that those who are not experts in the climate science field should not comment on it, for how could they possibly understand? I disagree. Scientific first principles are a basic foundation of understanding. They are accessible to anyone and everyone who cares to give any topic serious critical thought and consideration.

## Heat and Energy Conservation

Let's start these musings with the absolute basics. Humanity exists on the surface of a planet that is surrounded by space. Lots of it. Our planet Earth is captive to the gravitational field of a star, meaning that it continually orbits what we call the Sun within a group of bodies collectively known as the Solar System. Outside of the Solar System it is a long long way before then next nearest interstellar object is encountered (some XX light years until you reached XX assuming you set out in the right direction and it hadn't moved by the time you got there).

What this means is that for practical purposes we can consider the Solar System a closed system. Objects within the system do not interact with objects or the environment outside of the system. Within the closed system, objects do interact with each other. On the basis of current human knowledge, there are two main phenomenon that are of relevance here:

1. **Gravity:** Whilst it isn't clear to us exactly _how_ gravity works, we can observe its effects. The consequences of gravity range from large to small scales. Gravity doesn't differentiate, it just continuously acts as an attractive force between all mass. Gravitational force is what causes the Earth to orbit the Sun, our Moon to orbits the Earth and influence ocean tides on our surface, and for you to fall back to the ground when you jump into the air.
2. **Electromagnetic Radiation:** Energy can travel across the vacuum of space at the speed of light. Then energy itself has no mass or charge, but has been shown to travel in packets of radiant energy called photons which causes disturbances to electic and magnetic fields. Thus electromagnetic radiation (EM radiation) has both particle-like and wave-like behaviour. EM radiation covers a wide range of frequencies, most of which are invisible to the human eye. Within a narrow band of the EM spectrum we find visible light which we are able to see; we can even see the different frequencies naturally when a rainbow occurs -- the red colours have lower frequencies and the violet colours have higher frequencies. Outside the visible spectrum, at higher frequencies we find X-rays and gamma rays which we find a use for in medical imaging, and at lower frequencies we find infrared, microwaves and radio waves which are useful for communication technologies and the transfer of heat.

What is the relevance of this? Well, our Sun emits EM radiation into space equally in all directions. In addition to light, the EM radiation emitted by the sun includes the infrared part of the spectrum, meaning that in addition to light, the Sun provides us with heat. The further away we travel from the sun, the less intense the light and heat become as they become spread out over a larger area. Thanks to gravity, our planet Earth orbits the sun at a more or less fixed distance, meaning that the rate at which light and heat from the sun hits our planet is more or less constant. As will be shown later, using our knowledge of physics, we can actually calculate that amount of energy that reaches Earth from the Sun.

So where does that energy hitting the Earth from the Sun go to? Some of those photons hit the solar panels that we have sitting on the roof of our house and help make electricity for us which we can use, but of course that is just a tiny miniscule portion. What about the rest of the energy. Does it just accumulate and increase?

From a planetary perspective, the incident energy that reaches the planet (radiative heat from the sun) _must_ balance the heat emitted back out into space. This is self-evident. If there were no heat emitted back out into space (or simply less heat out than heat in) then over time the planet would heat up infinitely. Similarly, if more heat energy were emitted than received, then the planet's temperature would continue to decrease to absolute zero. As it is readily apparent that neither of these two extremes have been reached, we can conclude that over a period of time, there is a balance of heat (energy) for our planet.

This energy balance is a very useful tool. Through the lens of energy balance we can start to understand how our planet's climate is effected by different mechanisms, and to rank the importance of each of those.

However, we're getting ahead of ourselves. There are two statements I've just made that need to be justified. In saying that there must be a balance of energy in and out, I've assumed that there is no additional energy created or energy lost, and I've not explained how the planet can emit EM radiation.

### Principle of Energy Conservation

### Heat Emissions via Black Body Radiation

Stefan-Bolzmann equation.

Energy radiated by an ideal radiator

The constant is based on Stefan-Boltzmann's law, which states that the radiant heat energy emitted from a unit area of the black body in one second (E) is directly proportional to the fourth power of its absolute temperature, or E = σ x T^4.

Calculate energy from the sun incident on the earth.

### A Simple Heat Balance for the Earth

Let us first consider the simplest model of a planet. A planet orbits a star as a black body with a constant temperature. Because the temperature of the planet is constant and energy cannot be created or destroyed, the planet must emit the same amount of energy that it receives from the star.

### Changing Tilt of Earth's Spin

{:.notice}
Our planet spins on an axis that is tilted toward the orbital plane. Currently, this tilt (also called obliquity) deviates by 23.4 degrees from what would be a 90-degree angle toward the orbital plane. But this obliquity oscillates over time. Over the last million years, it has been swinging from 22.1-degrees to 24.5-degrees, according to NASA. 

During more tilted periods, the seasons on Earth get more extreme, as each hemisphere receives more sunlight in summer, when it's tilted toward the sun, and less in winter when it's tilted away. 

Over time, the longer winters lead to the expansion of polar ice caps and continental ice sheets. At the peak of ice ages, most of Earth's land could be covered in ice, the planet turning into an inhospitable snowball.

### Are We Destroying the Planet

The hubris of man. We won't destroy the planet. I can't even begin to imagine what sort of technology has the capability to eliminate a body of sufficiently large mass, such that gravity does not cause it to fall back in on itself. To destroy the planet you actually have to make the mass disappear, not just transform it. Perhaps with sufficient energy it would be possible to split the planet into multiple fragments and in doing so form another asteroid belt -- I can concede that would count as destroying the planet.

Planetary fragmentation aside (and carbon dioxide has its work cut out for it on that one), our Earth will continue to orbit the sun, and will almost certainly continue to harbour many different evolved forms of life, for billions more years.

When the alarms are raised that the planet it being destroyed, what is actually meant is that we are causing the collapse of civilisation. Our lifestyles, and those of our descendents, cannot continue indefinitely as changes to the environment around us will either impose the need to adapt or, if adaptation is unsuccessful, then civilisation's existence will be shown to be unsustainable and it will spiral downwards until it reaches its demise.

Often such a situation is given the label "unprecedented". Yet there are many examples from archeology of past civilisations that once flourished and were then lost to the world. Even though these civilisations are now a footnote to history, mankind was not wiped out. Indeed descendents from these former glorious civilisations almost certainly walk amongst us today.

Yes, mankind is its own worst enemy -- but it is more likely to be weapons of mass destruction and not carbon dioxide that brings a complete and terminal end to our species.
