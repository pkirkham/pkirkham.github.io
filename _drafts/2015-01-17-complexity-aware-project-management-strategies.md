Contrary to my recent post asserting that project complexity does not matter, and that it is instead project definition and planning that is at the heart of project success, I am now of the view that complexity does matter. Does this mean that my earlier post was wrong? Not quite, but it appears that in writing the blog post I have since been introduced to some novel thinking regarding "complexity". Whereas I had used the word merely to contrast with "simplicity", others in the project management field have recognised that projects don't just fall into two categories of simple versus complicated. Specifically the word "complexity" is used to describe projects with complicated interactions, and where uncertainty in those interactions can lead to emergent problems which are hard to predict using deterministic methods.

So my more enlightened view is that project complexity does matter, and should be avoided wherever possible through effective project definition and planning. In this blog post I explain why and how I have arrived at this different viewpoint.

## Complexity Versus Complication

[summarise literature review and include references.]

### Can We Measure Complexity?

[surely some combination of a project definition rating and the number of inter-related scope elements and disciplines in a single project]

## Strategies To Eliminate Complexity

### Don't Bite Off More Than You Can Chew

[clear objectives. agile analogy to breaking a project down into manageable stages. essentially this reduces the number of inter-related scope elements that must be managed e.g. reduces one part of our proposed complexity measure.]

### Fail To Plan, Plan To Fail

An alternative description for this strategy is a phrase I came across whilst in cadets at school: "prior planning and preparation prevents piss poor performance". Trust the military to come up with an expression that should be memorable to a squaddie capable of using alliterative language like, "f**king hell, the f**king f**ker's f**king f**ked". For the record I didn't make that up. I genuinely heard a squaddie say that in the ordinary course of a day.

Apologies to those offended by the language.

The other half of our complexity rating is the project definition rating. Logically we might conclude that if we reduce this, then this corresponds to a better understanding of our project definition: the 'why', 'where', 'what' and 'how' of our project. In doing so we are more aware of what is going on with our project during execution, and we are thus better prepared to manage any unexpected eventualities.

The answers to all four questions are important aspects of project definition:

1) **Why are we doing the project?** This is the basis of the project. Do we understand the objectives as set out by the business, for the project and indeed for our own discipline. What are the trade-offs such as those between capex and opex? Should we prioritise cost, schedule or production outcomes? Do we understand the basic data that will guide our choice of concept such as metocean or soil conditions, reservoir volumes, fluid properties etc.? Do we need to define the project carefully as the economics are marginal, and what about the significance of the project to our company or the host government? Should we expect interference?
2) **Where is the project located?** This is the project context and is the second foundation for any project definition. Is our location remote which might require complicated logistics? What about the contractors and vendors? Are there any available in the country or will fabrication need to be done elsewhere? Will doing so cause a problem for any local content requirements? Do we understand all the environmental, regulatory requirements in the host country and are we on track to obtain all necessary permits in a reasonable timeframe?
3) **What will the project involve?** This refers to the technical evaluation work that has been performed. Based on our knowledge of the basis of the project and the project context, we are able to design an appropriate solution that meets the project objectives whilst honouring and meeting all known constraints. Clearly defining the 'why' and 'where' of the project early is important as otherwise we might design the wrong 'what'. Have we captured and defined all the the scope necessary to meet the required functionality and capacities? Do we need to use new technology or can we use an existing standardised solution? Have we completed all the technical work necessary to build accurate cost and schedule estimates? Does our design include ancillary utilities and infrastructure or have we neglected this whilst we focused on the sexy process part of the scope? Have we incorporated input from HSE, operations etc? Is all our work documented?
4) **How will we execute the project?** This is the execution planning necessary to ensure the vision of the 'what' becomes a reality. Have we created our own schedule that incorporates input from all disciplines in the project, or will we just rely on whatever the contractors tell us? Do we understand what resource constraints we might face, and have we used that knowledge to help guide our development of the schedule? Are we actively managing risks and opportunities so that we mitigate the risks and try to realise the opportunities? Do we have effective project control plans so that won't just be a passenger on the Titanic and instead have the ability to anticipate trouble and steer the ship back on the right course? Have we worked out scenario plans (a.k.a. Plan B) to manage the risks that we have not been able to mitigate? Do we have a team where everyone is working towards a common goal?

Exactly how these project definition categories can be quantified and used to help identify areas of emergent complexity is something I am currently working on as part of my Pyrus Suite software. The goal is to create an integrated project simulation environment which will model all aspects of an oil and gas project from the reservoir to export point, including reservoir, wells and facilities across cost, schedule and production outcomes. An integrated tool should allow the effects of definition shortcomings to be simulated, so that it is possible to understand where there may be higher risk of emergent complexity in any project. As far as I know no such tool to do this exists today.

Areas of complication in a project, and how they might be affected by emergent complexity, also are discussed in an earlier post on "Does Complexity Matter". I have updated this post to better adhere to the distinction between complication and complexity, and I feel that the post now does a better job at explaining why particular aspects of a project need to be heeded in order to minimise the chance of emergent complexity. This post contains some worthwhile guidance on where to emphasise effort with respect to project definition.

### Are We Singing From The Same Hymn Sheet?

Complexity arises where there is uncertainty regarding the interaction between different system components. In the case of an oil and gas project, one interpretation of that is whether or not project team members appreciate and understand how their part of the project interacts with another. In particular, are they aware that choosing a less optimal solution for their particular scope is a potentially better choice because it eliminates problems in other parts of the system? If not then the chances are that discipline might start a chain reaction of problems elsewhere in the project.

When a group of people are working together towards a common goal then tremendous achievements can be accomplished. Complexity can be subdued. If there are separate 'warring factions' within a project, or silos of functional expertise that do not interact with each other, then the project is likely to take on a life of its own that is very difficult to control. Complexity will win.

It is said that people do projects, not processes. It is very true. A project process is a tool to ensure that projects are delivered to consistent standards, and to facilitate comparison between different projects (an important aspect of portfolio management). But the process does not do the project, nor will it ensure that the project is done well if the project team is merely gaming the system to appease management and merely appear to be managing the project well.

So if a project process is not the answer to achieving high performing teams that work well together, then what is? I don't believe there is a single answer to this question. There appear to be various strategies that work. However in all cases the strategies are compatible with the cultural sensitivities of the project team. Perhaps that is the key.

The two examples that I have are both project teams that I interviewed whilst working at Independent Project Analysis. For confidentiality reasons I cannot disclose the companies or the projects.

1) This team was from a western company that brought all its team members together at the project location. The head office didn't like it because of the cost involved, but the project manager believed it was in the best interest of the project. The capability of the team was exceptional, and I used the project anonymously as a 'gold standard' example with many other projects during my time at IPA. The culture of the project was one where everyone was encouraged to contribute, and information sharing was a part of the daily routine. Case in point: one of the facilities leads was able to explain the reservoir characteristics and uncertainties to me. Although this was far from the largest project in the company, the project leads had elevated the profile of the project by emphasising its importance to all team members, and by making it known that their contributions mattered. This was a 'touchy feely' approach that appealed to the sensibilities of people by recognising and rewarding individual input. In some respects this approach reminds me of a donkey being led along by a carrot.
2) This team was dealt a bad hand with their project. Difficult location, business-imposed schedule pressure that limited the project definition achieved, and just to add icing to the cake: it was a megaproject. By any measure of complexity, this was almost off the scale. Yet against all the odds, the project team delivered. There is perhaps some element of luck in the result that was achieved, but I suspect that the project culture had a part to play too. Where the previous project team was using the 'donkey and carrot' strategy, this project team was using the alternative 'donkey and stick' strategy. Actually I don't believe they did so by choice, but management had imposed this upon them, and the company came from a country where rigid hierarchical structures are normal. When the boss says that the public holiday next week does not apply for the project because the project schedule does not allow it, then the project team naturally asks, "what public holiday?". By the way, that wasn't an illustrative example, it actually happened. Whilst this approach may not appeal to western sensibilities, it has to be recognised that it forced everyone to work together, and in doing so they were able to contain the emergent complexity in the project. 

## Closing Thoughts

Emergent complexity in a project can and often will lead to poor outcomes. Any sane project management strategy should therefore seek to eliminate the potential for any complexity to emerge in a project, or failing that should ensure that the project team is capable to respond to a constantly evolving situation. In this post I have proposed three strategies that could be applied. These strategies are not mutually exclusive. Nor are they they only possible solutions, let alone necessarily the best solutions.

As a final thought I would draw your attention to the header image for this post. This is a scene from the original _The Italian Job_ movie where Michael Caine protests with the classic line, "You're only supposed to blow the bloody doors off!" in response to a test of the effectiveness of their explosives. The movie is a wonderful demonstration of how planning might lead to an excellent result, yet still emergent complexity manages to make an appearance towards the end.
