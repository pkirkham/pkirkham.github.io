There was a theme on LinkedIn to post career advice on what to do in the first 90 days of a new job. Strangely enough this is exactly the situation that I find myself in.

Reading through some of the articles that other LinkedIn users have shared uncovers some common pieces of advice. I thought it might be useful to collect together some of those pieces of advice, and then add my own recent experience to see if I could 'road-test' the advice.
