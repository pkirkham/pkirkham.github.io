A common approach to modelling relative permeability curves for input to a reservoir simulator is to match synthetic curves to measured rock data or to use the actual measured curves with appropriate smoothing. The measured rock data is obtained from special core analysis (SCAL). A downside is that this requires a representative sample of core from the reservoir, which is very hard to achieve with highly heterogeneous formations. For that reason Pyrus has implemented a tool that allows the relative permeability curves to be modelled using other fundamental rock data, instead of SCAL.
