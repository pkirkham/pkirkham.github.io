		<h2 class="post-title">About Myself</h2>
		<p class="post-excerpt">So far I've been fortunate to have a varied career that includes working for smaller independents, creating new start-up companies and project consulting. This work has taken me around the globe, living and working in Australia, Singapore, UK and USA. Along the way I've seen most aspects of exploration, development and production, both big and small.</p>
