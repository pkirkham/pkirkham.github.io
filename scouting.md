As a father to four young boys, it was inevitable that I would somehow be roped into what might be deemed 'proper' fatherly activities. The scouting movement has been going for over a century and the values it teaches young children are as relevant today as they were when Lord Baden-Powell first conceptualised them. The 1st Singapore Scouts are part of the UK Scouts (our county is "British Scouting Overseas" and district is "Rest of the World"), and I am the Scout Leader of the troop. I also help out with Cub Scouts for the Dover Court International School (DCIS) Cubs, and my wife is the Beaver Scout Leader for the DCIS Beavers.

My wife and I first joined the scouting family when the DCIS Cubs and Beavers were formed in 2016. All leaders were volunteer parents, and none of us knew what to expect. The first meeting was an eye-opener into the world of small children. Needless to say I have a healthy appreciation for teachers these days.

There is a wealth of information and guides that others have written to offer suggestions on putting together a good scouting programme. These pages are my personal notes of our scouting journey in Singapore, and perhaps they may be of interest to others in a similar position?
