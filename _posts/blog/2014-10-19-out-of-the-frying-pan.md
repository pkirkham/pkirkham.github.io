After four years at [Independent Project Analysis (IPA)](www.ipaglobal.com) I've moved back into the oil industry. Truth be told, I never really left, but for the past four years or so I've been working at IPA as a project analyst. This role has given me (and my former colleagues) the rather unique opportunity to watch oil and gas projects as they evolve from the early stages of planning through execution and ultimately start-up. For those that are familiar with the TV programme _Grand Designs_, the analogy I often use should explain it well. Essentially an IPA project analyst is like being the Kevin McCloud of the industrial world. Like many of the houses being build on that programme, it turns out that many oil and gas projects might have a firm idea of how much it will cost and how long it will take before they start, but few of them achieve their goals. Through statistical analysis of data from hundreds of oil and gas projects, IPA has been able to develop an insight into what drives successful projects, and what is likely to lead to failure.

## Into The Fire

My new job is with the small but promising oil and gas venture [Twinza Oil](www.twinzaoil.com). The main asset is the Pasca A gas-condensate field in Papua New Guinea which is under development, having started FEL 2 around about the time that I joined the company. One of my roles is to be involved in delivery of the project, and ensure that the project delivers the optimum commercial value to the business.

Given my recent work with IPA which involved gaining insight into the various tradeoffs between cost, schedule and operability targets that a project may set, one might think that this should be a straightforward task. Sadly the reality is that my IPA experience merely makes me more aware of all the potential pitfalls. It is going to be a daunting task ahead, but one that will allow me to finally get to put much of what I have learned about oil and gas asset development into practice.
